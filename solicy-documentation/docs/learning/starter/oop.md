# OOP

## What Is Object-oriented Programming?

Object-oriented Programming treats data as a crucial element in program development and doesn't allow it to flow freely around the system. It ties data more securely to the function that operates on it and protects it from accidental modification from an outside function. OOP breaks down a problem into several entities called objects and builds data and functions around these objects.

## Objects

Objects are the basic run-time bodies in an object-oriented framework. They may represent a place, a person, an account, a table of data, or anything that the program needs to handle. Objects can also represent user-defined data such as vectors, time, and lists.

Consider two objects, “customer” and “account” in a program. The customer object may send a message requesting the bank balance. 

## Classes

We know that objects hold the data and the functions to manipulate the data. However, the two can be bound together in a user-defined data type with the help of classes. Any number of objects can be created in a class. Each object is associated with the data of type class. A class is therefore a collection of objects of similar types. 

For example, consider the class “Fruits”. We can create multiple objects for this class -

Fruit Mango;

This will create an object mango belonging to the class fruit.  

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the wrapping up/binding of data and function into a single unit called class. Data encapsulation is the most prominent feature of a class wherein the data is not accessible to the outside world, and only those functions wrapped inside the class can access it. These functions serve as the interface between the object’s data and the program. 

## Inheritance

The phenomenon where objects of one class acquire the properties of objects of another class is called Inheritance. It supports the concept of hierarchical classification. Consider the object “car” that falls in the class “Vehicles” and “Light Weight Vehicles”.

In OOP, the concept of inheritance ensures reusability. This means that additional features can be added to an existing class without modifying it. This is made possible by deriving a new class from the existing one.
